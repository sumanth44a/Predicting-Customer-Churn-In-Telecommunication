## Objective:
The objective is to create a machine learning models like Decision Tree Random Forest and Naive Bayes for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. By analyzing historical data, the goal is to forecast which customers are likely to discontinue services. This predictive capability enables proactive measures to retain at-risk customers, ultimately reducing churn rates and improving overall customer satisfaction.

## Components:
  - Data Preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Model Development
  - Model Evaluation

## Dataset:
  - [Telecommunication Customer Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhartiprasad17/customer-churn-prediction/input)
  - The Above dataset contains information of:
     - Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
     - Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and          movies
     - Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.
     - Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.

## Libraries: 
  - Matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, and NumPy

## Exploratory data analysis:
 - Checking Trends Between Target and other features:
